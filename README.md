[![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Days-0%2F100-red?style=for-the-badge)](#-the-100-days)

> A free, self-paced, 100-day curriculum that takes you from "I've read about prompt injection" to "I've run garak, PyRIT, and promptfoo against real models, built a working RAG-injection exploit, deployed guardrails, scanned a model for pickle RCE, and can map any attack to OWASP LLM Top 10 / OWASP Agentic Top 10 / MITRE ATLAS."

No theory dumps. Every single day links to one real, verifiable resource — a paper, a tool, a CTF, or a disclosed CVE — and ends in something you can point to and say "I did that." Fork it, check off days as you go, and post your progress with `#100DaysOfAISecurity`.

**New to the field?** Start at Day 1. **Already know the basics?** Jump straight to whichever week matches what you're missing — every day stands on its own.

---

## Why this exists

The "100 Days of X" format has a real track record — [`100-Days-Of-ML-Code`](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code) is one of the most-starred learning repos on GitHub. AI security has never had one. This is it: built from a working curriculum ([`ai-security-resources`](https://github.com/ppradyoth/ai-security-resources)) that's already cited and cross-referenced against primary sources — not 100 days of filler.

**The rule for every entry in this repo:** if it's a paper, it's linked to arXiv or the publisher. If it's a tool, it's linked to its GitHub repo with an honest maintenance status. If it's a CVE, it's a real CVE number. Nothing here is invented to pad the count to 100.

---

## How to use this

1. Fork the repo.
2. Each day: read/do the linked thing, then check the box in your fork (or just track it in a notebook — the checkboxes are for you, not for us).
3. Skip days that are already easy for you. This is a curriculum, not a prison sentence.
4. Stuck, or found a dead link / outdated CVE reference? Open an issue — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
5. Day 100 ends with a real capstone (a disclosed finding or a published tool) — that's the artifact you actually put on your résumé.

## What you'll have after Day 100

- Hands-on reps with **garak, PyRIT, promptfoo, mcp-scan, ModelScan, LLM Guard, NeMo Guardrails, Langfuse, and Invariant** — not just reading about them.
- A working local exploit for indirect RAG injection, a pickle-RCE PoC, and a from-scratch guardrail proxy.
- Fluency mapping any attack to **OWASP LLM Top 10**, **OWASP Agentic Top 10 (ASI01–10)**, and **MITRE ATLAS**.
- A real, published capstone — a disclosed finding or a shipped tool — that's an actual portfolio artifact, not a certificate of completion.

If you want the exhaustive, non-day-boxed version of all of this — including the full tooling catalog, incident tracker, and salary/career data — it lives in the companion repo: **[`ai-security-resources`](https://github.com/ppradyoth/ai-security-resources)**.
